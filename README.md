Didactic material prepared for CAS 522 - Dynamical Systems

In this classic example, we build and train a simple feedforward neural network using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to classify handwritten digits from the *MNIST* dataset. It includes data loading, normalization, flattening, model definition, compilation, training, and evaluation. Finally, it prints the test accuracy to show how well the model performs on unseen data.

In the following example, we will see how this simple idea can be adapted and built upon to handle problems involving dynamical systems, once we modify our input representation.
